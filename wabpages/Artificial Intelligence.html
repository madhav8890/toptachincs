    <h1>Artificial Intelligence(AI)</h1>
    <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence(AI)</h2>
    <p>
         Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines<br>
         that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions. The term may also be applied to any machine that<br>
         exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning  and problem-solving.<br>
         The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize<br>
          and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.
    </p>
    <h2>Understanding Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
         When most people hear the term artificial intelligence, the first thing they usually think of<br>
         is robots. That's because big-budget films and novels weave stories about human-like machines<br>
          that wreak havoc on Earth. But nothing could be further from the truth. Artificial intelligence<br>
         is based on the principle that human intelligence can be defined in a way that a machine can easily<br>
          mimic it and execute tasks, from the most simple to those that are even more complex. The goals<br>
           of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and perception.
    </p>
    <p>
         As technology advances, previous benchmarks that defined artificial intelligence become outdated.<br>
         For example, machines that calculate basic functions or recognize text through optimal character<br>
          recognition are no longer considered to embody artificial intelligence, since this function is<br>
           now taken for granted as an inherent computer function.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
         The applications for artificial intelligence are endless. The technology can be applied to many different<br>
         sectors and industries. AI is being tested and used in the healthcare industry for dosing drugs and different<br>
          treatment in patients, and for surgical procedures in the operating room.
    </p>
    <p>
         Other examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess and self-driving cars.<br>
         Each of these machines must weigh the consequences of any action they take, as each action will impact the end<br>
          result. In chess, the end result is winning the game. For self-driving cars, the computer system must account<br>
           for all external data and compute it to act in a way that prevents a collision.
    </p>
    <p>
         Artificial intelligence also has applications in the financial industry, where it is used to detect and flag activity<br>
         in banking and finance such as unusual debit card usage and large account depositsâ€”all of which help a bank's fraud<br>
          department. Applications for AI are also being used to help streamline and make trading easier. This is done by making<br>
           supply, demand, and pricing of securities easier to estimate.

    <h3>KEY TAKEWAYS</h3>
        <li>
             Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence<br>
             in machines.
        </li>
         <li>
             The goals of artificial intelligence include learning, reasoning, and<br>
             perception.
        </li>
         <li>
             AI is being used across different industries including finance and<br>
             healthcare.
        </li>
         <li>
             Weak AI tends to be simple and single-task oriented, while strong AI<br>
             carries on tasks that are more complex and human-like.
        </li>
        <h2>Categorization of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
             Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories:<br>
              weak and strong. Weak artificial intelligence
             embodies a system designed to carry out one<br>
              particular job. Weak AI systems include video games such as the chess<br>
               example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and<br>
                Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant a question, it answers it for you.
        </p>
        <p>
             trong artificial intelligence systems are systems that carry on the tasks<br>
             considered to be human-like. These tend to be more complex and complicated systems.<br>
              They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be required to problem<br>
               solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in <br>
               applications like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.
        </p>
        <h2>Special Considerations</h2>
        <p>
             Since its beginning, artificial intelligence has come under scrutiny from scientists and<br>
             the public alike. One common theme is the idea that machines will become so highly developed<br>
              that humans will not be able to keep up and they will take off on their own, redesigning<br>
               themselves at an exponential rate.
        </p>
        <p>
             Another is that machines can hack into people's privacy and even be weaponized. Other <br>
             arguments debate the ethics of artificial intelligence and whether intelligent systems<br>
             such as robots should be treated with the same rights as humans.
        </p>
        <p>
             Self-driving cars have been fairly controversial as their machines tend to be designed for the<br>
             lowest possible risk and the least casualties. If presented with a scenario of colliding with<br>
              one person or another at the same time, these cars would calculate the option that would<br>
               cause the least amount of damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another contentious issue many people have with artificial intelligence is how it may affect<br>
             human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs through the use of<br> 
             intelligent machinery, there is a concern that people would be pushed out of the workforce.<br>
              Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers<br>
               may easily replace human labor with machines, making people's skills more obsolete.
