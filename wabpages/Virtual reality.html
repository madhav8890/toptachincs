<h1>What Is Virtual Reality</h1>
<p>
    Today the Virtual reality (VR) technology is applied to advance fields of medicine, engineering, education, design, training, and entertainment. VR is a computer interfaces which tries to mimic real world beyond the flat monitor to give an immersive 3D (Three Dimension) visual experiences. Often it is hard to reconstruct the scales and distances between objects in static 2D images. Thus the third dimension helps bringing depth to objects.

<h1>Virtual Reality (VR) vs Agumented Reality (AR)</h1>
<p>
    Augmented Reality (AR) that places computer generated objects on top of real world to make it more meaningful and interacting with it. The good example of AR would be PokemonGo game and IKEA app. The IKEA app uses camera so users can visualize the products being placed at their home.

<p>VR and AR, they don’t have winners or losers as they are being better in their respective way of use. VR, for example, is terrific for gaming and watching video. Being able to fully immerse yourself is incredible, and nearly all the experiences wouldn't feel the same in AR. At the same time, the ability to interact with the physical world while seeing elements of the virtual world is fantastic for productivity and some forms of entertainment, and long term could be a default for how we interact with all kinds of computer interfaces.
