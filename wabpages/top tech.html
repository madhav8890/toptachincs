            <p>
                 The IoT (Internet of Things) is a network of devices that are connected to each other. Their devices<br>
                 caninteract and share data with each other. These devices may be connected via WiFi, and they share<br>
                 data about their environments and how they are being used. These devices have a computer chip that<br>
                 facilitates this exchange.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\Madhav Prajapati\Documents\madhav prajapati\imges\mkpp.jpg" width="650" height="350">
            <p>
                It is predicted that more than 41 billion devices powered by IoT will be used by 2025.
            </p>
            <p>
                IoT not only enables the connection between different devices but also their remote access. For example, <br>
                you lock doors of your car remotely, preheat your ovens and geysers. The<br>
                 FitBit that you use for tracking the number of calories you burn also runs on IoT

            <a name="Blockchain"><h3>4. Blockchain</h3></a>
            <p>
                Blockchain is the foundational technology that powers electronic currencies such <br> 
                Cryptocurrencies. In simple terms, a Blockchain is an electronic ledger that can be<br>
                 shared among different users. This helps in creating a record of transactions that cannot be <br>
                altered. Each of these records is time-stamped and linked to the previous one.
            </p>
            <img src="C:\Users\Madhav Prajapati\Documents\madhav prajapati\imges\MKPA.jpg" width="650" height="350">

            <p>
                So every time a new transaction is added to the ledger, it is stored as another block<br>
                 in the chain of transactions – hence the name. Blockchain is updated after the different<br>
                  parties contributing to the ledger agree. After new data is
                 into a block, it cannot be erased. <br> This makes technology verifiable and secure.
            </p>
            <p>
                This validation of transactions helps companies reduce their costs as no third party has<br>
                 to be paid. The system is very secure and there is no need for paying for centralized entities,<br>
                 as the technology is decentralized. Transactions are easier to track using Blockchain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a rise in careers in Blockchain and it will create different job positions which are as follows:
            </p>
            <li>Blockchain Developer</li>
            <li>Blockchain Quality Engineer</li>
            <li>Blockchain Legsl Consultant or Attorney</li>
            <li>Blockchain Engineer</li>

            <p>
                VR is the technology by which you can immerse yourself in an environment that seems <br>
                astonishingly realistic. It is the use of computer technology for creating a simulated <br>
                environment. It is very popularly used for playing computer games. Unlike traditional games<br>
                 where you experience the gaming 
                environment by viewing it on the screen, you<br> are directly placed in the environment!

            </p> 
            <img src="C:\Users\Madhav Prajapati\Documents\madhav prajapati\imges\mK.jpg" width="650" height="350">

            <p>
                Senses such as touch, hearing, smell, and vision are simulated in these environments. Using VR<br>
                 gear such as headsets, you can walk around and play the game in that
                 3D world. Augmented Reality<br> (AR) is the technology used for improving this virtual environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The major players in this field are Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Sony’s PlayStation VR (PSVR), and the HTC Vive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The VR technology is not only used for entertainment, but it is also used by the U.S. Navy<br>
                 and Coast Guard for training staff. They use a VR game called VirtualShip. AR and VR are used <br>
                 by doctors while performing surgery. Visitors 
                in an amusement park or a museum<br> can also use the technology to enhance their experience. 
            </p>
            <P>
                The VR industry is expected to reach close to $40 billion by 2021. Here are some VR job positions you can look out for:
            </P>
            <li>Content Producer</li>
            <li>AR and VR Content Writers</li>
            <li>Product Management</li>

            <a name="Edge Computing"><h3>7. Edge Computing</h3></a>
          
            <p>Edge computing is the latest technology trend that is getting famous by the day. The technology is based <br>
                on the philosophy 
                of bringing computing power as close to the data source. This helps in reducing<br> bandwidth and latency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The technology aims to run fewer processes in the cloud and shifting those processes to locations such <br>
                as the user’s system or an edge server. Bridging this gap between the data and the computation reduces the<br>
                 long-distance communication between the server and the client, which in turn enhances the speed of the process.<br>
                  This is why edge computing is used for handling time-sensitive data stored in remote locations that have <br>
                  limited 
                connectivity to the central location. The technology will make cloud computing and IoT devices faster. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                 It is estimated that by 2022, the edge computing market will be worth $7 billion. The technology will<br>
                 be popular in areas such as healthcare, retail, and manufacturing. Thus, it will open the doors to many <br>
                 job opportunities. It is expected that
                 the salary range of an Edge <br>computing professional will be around $100,400 to $123,000 per annum.
            </p>

            <a name="Intelligent apps"><h3>8. Intelligent apps</h3></a>
            <p>Intelligent apps are software applications that make use of AI components <br>
                such as machine learning, deep learning, data analytics, robotics, and natural language processing.<br>
                 They help you in making decisions based on real-time data or historical data.</p>
            <p>Examples of Intelligent apps are voice assistants such as Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa.<br>
                 As companies such as Google, Apple, and Oracle continue investing in these applications, it<br>
